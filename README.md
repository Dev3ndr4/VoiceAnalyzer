Subject: Tech Stack & Feature Improvements - Voice Analyzer
Introduction
This report summarizes the recent enhancements made to the tech stack and key features of Voice Analyzer. The primary goals of these improvements were to implement the feedback received from the interviewer, streamline backend processes, and create a more intuitive and versatile user experience.
Tech Stack Changes
Backend: The backend was migrated to Python to leverage its robust libraries for machine learning and data processing, ultimately improving code maintainability and efficiency.
Translation Model: The implementation of the "Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-mul-en" model has significantly increased the accuracy and fluency of translations. This powerful model is specifically designed to handle multiple languages, aligning perfectly with expanding language support goals.
UI Feature Enhancements
Image Hover Displaying Original Text: An image has been integrated into the UI, offering a visual representation of the original text when the user hovers over it. This feature aims to provide a quick visual reference for users, enhancing their understanding and interaction with the translated content.
Multi-Language Dropdown: Allowing users to select between a wider range of languages.




**Project Title: Voice Analyzer**

**Project Overview:**

The Voice Analyzer application is a web-based tool designed to capture, process, and provide valuable insights into user speech patterns. It leverages the Web Speech API to enable real-time speech input and transcription directly within the browser for interactive user experience. 

**Key Features & Implementation:**

1. **Real-time Speech Recognition:**
   * Utilizes the Web Speech API (`webkitSpeechRecognition` or `SpeechRecognition`) to capture user speech input via the browser's microphone. 
   * Sets recognition language to 'en-US'..
   * Provides visual feedback to the user during recognition (active microphone icon, "Listening..." indicator).

2. **Transcription & Translation:**
   * Converts recognized speech into text (transcription) using the API's built-in capabilities.

3. **Transcription History & Storage:**
   * Stores all transcriptions securely in a MySQL database for future reference and analysis.
   * Presents users with a history of their transcriptions within the application.

4. **Word Frequency Analysis:**
   * Processes transcriptions to calculate the frequency of individual words used by each user.
   * Displays a table of the most frequently used words for the current user.
   * Compares the user's word frequency against the aggregate frequency across all users, highlighting individual speech patterns and trends.

5. **Unique Phrase Identification:**
   * Showcases the top 3 unique phrases spoken by each user, providing insights into their individual linguistic style.

6. **Speech Similarity Detection (Future Implementation):**
   * Envisions displaying a list of the most similar users via similarity score.

**Technology Stack:**

* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (including the Web Speech API for core speech recognition functionality)
* **Backend:** PHP (to handle API requests, data processing, and database interactions)
* **Database:** MySQL (for secure and efficient storage of user data and transcriptions)
